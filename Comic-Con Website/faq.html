         <section>   
            <h4>Q: How do I get an autograph or signed print at the show?</h4>
            <p>Simply go to the first floor (Liffey Level) and join the queue.
               Please note that waiting times may vary and some queues can be longer than others.
               If you have a Fast Pass for autographs then be sure to join the correct queue. You
               can find the Fast Pass on the main ticketing page.</p>

            <h4>Q: Do I need a VIP ticket to meet the guests or get an autograph?</h4>
            <p>No, once you have a general entry ticket you may go up and say hello to a guest 
               at their table, simply join the queue. If you wish to have a signed print or an item 
               autographed then you must purchase one, the same goes for photos/selfies at their table.</p>

            <h4>Q: What is the guest Fast Pass?</h4>
            <p>The Fast Pass allows you to join a much shorter queue and complete all your signings much quicker than if you were in the normal queues. It is applicable to all guests.
               Simply purchase it online (supplies are limited!) and pick up your Fast Pass wristband at the Guest Merchandise desk located on the First floor near the guests.</p>

            <h4>Q: Can I bring the guest an item of mine and have them sign it? </h4>
            <p>Yes, you can but please note the cost will be the same to get a signature on the said item. You are allowed get 5 items signed at any one time then you must queue
               again to keep the flow moving. Guests reserve the right to refuse to sign items they deem offensive or inappropriate.</p>
            <p>Autographs can range from 15 Euro to 50 Euro depending on the guest and generally gets you a signed photograph of the guest. Most guests will sign other items
               (ie. DVD's, props etc) if you bring them and ask nicely. As the event gets closer we will list the price along side each guest. You must follow staff and DCC volunteers
               instructions and queue in the correct area and pay before your item is signed. VIP Ticket holders have priority queueing in this area.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that we do not set the price of autographs. Some guests give discounts if getting multiple signatures on items or signed photographs.
               If you have more than 5 items to get signed you will be asked to come back after the first 5 are signed or to leave them and collect them from the guest's table later so that others may get signatures.
               If you can not attend the event or are working at a stall and can not get an autograph, we will offer a facility where you can pre purchase an autograph
               and it is sent out to your home address 10 working days after the show. This will be launched closer to the event.</p>
