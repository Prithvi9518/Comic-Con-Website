            <p>With 20,000 + attendees at each of our Dublin Comic Con event's (not counting our 
               other Comic Con Ireland run events) we provide a unique and wide-reaching platform
               for you to target a wide demographic. From die-hard ( and tech savvy ) fans and families
               to casual fans, we attract a large new and returning customer base as well as an ever-growing fan base.</p>

               and sponsors is unparalleled. Comic Con Ireland events enjoy a large and dedicated media base, with
               long-standing relationships at national and international press outlets that guarantees coverage for every event.</p>
